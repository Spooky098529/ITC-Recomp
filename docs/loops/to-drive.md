# To check in a drive

The functions the B7 loop made native that have no `native running
(game):` line yet: not seen in the validation's attract race or the pad
replay, nor in a drive since. Kept across runs (not started afresh like
`b7-progress.md`); the lead adds each validation's `not in game:` line
here, under its run, with the `replay:` line beside it when the replay
broke. Their harnesses ran our code; this is the validation done by
playing.

The user drives (menus, a race, a save) with `--log_level=info`; a
function goes from this list when a log shows its `native running
(game):` line (say which log in the commit). A run with nothing left
here loses its heading.

Not in the drive `itc_1015.log` (2026-10-23) either.

Not in the attract race or the replay (`itc_932`, `itc_933`, ok); never
seen in play before either (the 32-bit and node channel tracks):

- `sub_825A0FE0` TrackSet::Sample32 (`model-animation.md`)
- `sub_825A10A8` TrackSet::Advance32 (`model-animation.md`)

Not in the attract race or two replays (`itc_922`, `itc_924`, both ok);
