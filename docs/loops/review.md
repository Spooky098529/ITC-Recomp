# For the user's review

What the B7 loop's runs left for the user to review before a merge: the
function files' rows added or changed, and the choices made in them
(behavior kept or left on the recompiled path, corrections to a map).
Kept across runs (not started afresh like `b7-progress.md`), newest run
first; the lead adds to the current run's section as reports come in.
Harness groups expected to differ are in `expected-differences.md`, the
functions to check in a drive in the progress file.

When the user has reviewed a run's section, its heading gets
"(reviewed <date>)"; the section stays for the record.

## Run 2026-10-23 13:44 (`b7-loop-23-10-26-3`)

- `model-animation.md` (new, 36 rows; 0 moved, 36 new; mapped in
  c425049), `known-data.md` (the model's +304 to +384 spelled out; new
  rows: the track set, the animation section with its 20-byte keys,
  the skeleton); 5 leads. For review: `models.md`'s `sub_82599A20`
  corrected (the per-node float4s' x, y, z set to 0.0, not 1.0) and
  `sub_8259A9E0`'s row given its r6 instance count (+160) and the
  per-instance cursors at +128; the primitive drawer (`sub_825A1438`,
  `sub_825A16B0`, `sub_825A17A0`) and `sub_825A18D8` aren't animation
  but have rows, as the lead named them; `sub_825A5778` to
  `sub_825A6460` are probably XAudio's effects (XAPO), not animation (a
  lead); only some track sets ran in play (the +364 material animation
  and +384 sets' helpers and `sub_825A20E8` never did); Model::Animate
  advances times by 1.0 a call from `sub_820F6068`, probably on
  render-only passes too (not checked).
  Migration 1's 36 rows (6f51fc2, 6714e72; `--native_model_animation`;
  16 Native, written without adapters as only native callers reach
  them; 3 new rows, Native and not seen in play: `sub_825A0FE0`,
  `sub_825A10A8`, `sub_825A20E8`; `models.md`'s `sub_8259C3A8` Native,
  named Skeleton::UpdateNodeMatrices; left: the primitive drawer's
  vtable methods, blocked by the graphics device). For review: the
  releases, set-ups, frees, destructors and the drawer's constructor
  run natively only under `--native_heap`, handing the call to the
  original when free or operator new would refuse it (the collision
  precedent), and abort if `OperatorNewArray` fails after those checks;
  `TrackSet::Setup208` is native only for sections with no tracks (all
  in play) and `sub_8259C3A8` hands node types 8 and 16 to the
  original, so `sub_825A6608`, `sub_825A1938`, `sub_8259B748` and
  `sub_8259BE40` stay recompiled (both checks assume the data isn't
  written during the call); `sub_8259C3A8` notes its multiplies with
  `BlendState_OnMultiply` under the original's return addresses;
  `Curve::Sample` corrected (before the second key it interpolates the
  first two, not clamps); the harnesses never build node types 8 or 16
  or Setup208 sections with tracks; the new code reuses
  `car_physics/float_ops.h` and `xact::WaveEntryConstruct`.
- `car-specs.md` (already mapped from the game data check; the map
  checked by the lead, not remapped). Migration 1's 46 rows (d87b553,
  04c3ebd, f1727ea, 80867d4, 114aa35; `--native_car_specs`; 9 adapters
  removed and 25 Native with no adapter; 12 unnamed rows named, among
  them `Car::CopySpec` `sub_820C4888`, `Car::CopyAeroParts`
  `sub_820C4568`, `CountBodyKits` `sub_820CBD20`; left: `Params::Load`,
  blocked by the archive, and `Params::Free`, not seen in play). For
  review: the swaps byte-swap integers where the original round-trips
  through lfs/stfs (folded in `generated/`; the harness checks
  signaling NaNs and denormals); the archive's TOC lookup `sub_8209D868`
  (no row anywhere) stays a guest call from the adapters; the four load
  callbacks keep their adapters (reached through a function pointer);
  `Car::Refresh` runs the original if a copy wouldn't be the host's
  memcpy or the car's span overlaps a source (never taken), its aero
  getters write into the car directly and the 36-byte parts block is a
  host array; the float adapters turn flush-to-zero off unconditionally
  (the data tables' precedent); `sub_820CB0C0`'s leftover r3 reproduced;
  the Refresh, CopySpec, CopyAeroParts and InchUp harnesses use made-up
  tables (the game's load after the harnesses), and some cases point
  the parameter global at a test object for the call (the data tables'
  precedent: the load callbacks run when the main thread lets them);
  `Params::Init` native only under `--native_heap`.
- `cameras.md` (new, 42 rows; 6 moved from `functions.md`, still
  Wrapped with their old text, 36 new; mapped in 8fb7201): the library's
  `Camera` class, the 21 camera passes at `0x826BAC00` and their render
  targets, the two 1,872-byte viewports at `[0x826C2CE8]`; 4 leads (the
  camera modes at `82152028`-`82156CC0`, a second camera class, the
  graphics device's resource calls, memset and atexit), and
  `sub_820AB408`, `sub_820AB498` added to the route lead. For review:
  `known-data.md`'s `0x826C2CE8` row corrected (1,872-byte viewports of
  twenty 80-byte entries, not 80-byte records) with new rows for
  `0x826BABC0`-`0x826BABFC`, the viewport and its entry; a reversed
  depth range from `Camera::BuildProjection` (+384 near, +388 far);
  "probably" for mode 1's passes 4-9 as a cube map's faces, the entries'
  +68 as a focal length in pixels; `CameraPass::RecordBegin`,
  `RecordEnd` and `Viewport::UpdateEntries` not read in detail.

## Run 2026-10-23 11:06 (`b7-loop-23-10-26-2`)

- `action-mappers.md` (new, 40 rows; 15 moved from `functions.md`, 25
  new), 4 `known-data.md` rows (the globals `0x826BAB78`/`7C`/`80`, the
  client list at `0x82970C14`, the settings table at
  `0x82600B84`/`B88`, the action mapper's layout); 2 leads (the input
  processor's constructors, the app's start-up). For review: the read
  slots never seen in play (`sub_8210BA68`, `sub_8210BED8`,
  `sub_8210BFA8`) stay in `functions.md`; of the button tests only
  `sub_8258CF10` and `sub_825924E0` (called only by the mappers) moved;
  `sub_8210C370`'s old note (a copy of MenuList::Update's) kept, with
  the real description after it; the config slots
  (`sub_8210B698`, `sub_8210BDF0`, `sub_8210BE30`) matched to their
  slots from `sub_8209F228`'s arguments and the constants' values,
  both "probably" (the vtables and tables weren't read from the image).
  Migration 1's 36 rows (`--native_action_mappers`; 10 Native, adapters
  removed; 4 rows left: `sub_8210AF08` BindAll and `sub_8210B270` Bind,
  whose 7 calls into the input manager's vtables aren't identified, and
  `sub_8210C180`, `sub_8209F430`, blocked by `sub_8258CE60`). No behavior
  change (the user's call, 2026-10-23: migrate off the recompiled code
  only): every harness matches exactly, the registers the originals
  leave behind too; the per-tick override of `sub_8210B018` still skips
  render-only passes first. For review: bits 30-31 of the held,
  pressed and released words come from an uninitialized stack word in
  `sub_8210BBA0` (r25's high half as saved by `sub_8210B7D0`), and the
  native code is handed the same value (`docs/pause-menu-fix.md`); the
  update, Configure and the set-up run the original unless every repeat
  and curve object's slot is the function seen in play; their slot 0
  (`sub_8243DC88`, `sub_82106540`, shared with other classes) done in
  place, no rows; the `--log_pause_menu` and `--log_input_reads`
  diagnostics moved into `src/hooks/action_mappers.cpp` over new helpers
  in `src/debug/pause_menu_log` and `src/frame_pacing/game_messages`,
  and the adapters of `sub_8210C370`, `sub_8258CF10`, `sub_825924E0`
  kept for them on the fallback path; c67265f has a batch and four
  adapter removals together; new names `InputProcessor::AllHeld`,
  `TestHeld`, `ActionMapper::Held`, `Pressed`, `Fired`, `AnalogRaw`,
  `SetThreshold`, `SetRepeat`, `SetCurve`.
- `data-tables.md` (new, 18 rows, none moved): `[0x826C5CA0]`'s set-up
  (`sub_82116DB0`), twelve asset loads (94: 400 items of 3,008 bytes,
  "probably" the game's items, keyed by the save data's 12-byte records
  at +0x199F8; 84 with no reader but the load; eight 56-byte tables from
  the ids at `0x82616C64`; 95's 20-byte and 96's 40-byte entries), their
  load callbacks byte-swapping the 56-, 20- and 40-byte tables in place
  (the items aren't), and the accessors; 4 `known-data.md` rows; 4 leads
  (the boot data load, the save data's items, `82140340`-`82144E58`, the
  front-end callers at `822271F8`-`8222F0B0`). For review: the eight
  asset ids at `0x82616C64` not recorded (they need an image dump; one
  outside the repo wasn't used); `SwapWord` (`sub_820C97D8`) swaps a
  word through a float load and store, which in the recompiled code
  probably quiets a signaling NaN's bits (the 360 wouldn't): the native
  code keeps the recompiled result (no behavior change, the user's
  call; see migration 1 below: there's no quieting).
  Migration 1's 16 rows (`--native_data_tables`; 4 Native: SwapWord and
  the three entry swaps; left: DataTables::Init and Load, blocked by
  the archive's `sub_8209DE48`, `sub_8209D868`, `sub_820A0678`). For
  review: SwapWord's float round trip is folded away by the compiler in
  the release build (a plain byte swap; signaling NaNs come through
  unchanged), and the native code writes the same steps under the same
  floating-point settings, so it folds the same (256 signaling-NaN
  patterns compared exactly; the mapping's "probably quieted" corrected
  in the row); the adapter turns flush-to-zero off as the original
  does, and doesn't set f0 (no caller reads it); the accessors return
  r3 zero-extended where the originals keep the argument's upper 32
  bits (as the vehicle accessors do: the game reads the low word only);
  Entry56, Find20, Entry20, Entry40 and ItemRecords::Item weren't seen
  in the attract race (the front end, the save data); the five load
  callbacks keep their adapters (reached through Archive::Load's
  function pointer), the seven accessors too (recompiled callers).
  After the run's validation: `sub_82116DA8`'s adapter calls a new
  one-line `data_tables::RecordsItem` (over `Item`) with its own print,
  as its harness step does (the user's call).

## Run 2026-10-23 01:52 (`b7-loop-23-10-26`)

- `sound-cues.md` (new, 87 rows; 4 moved from `functions.md`:
  `sub_8259D1A8`, `sub_821184E8`, `sub_82118FB0`, `sub_82118C18`), 8 new
  `known-data.md` rows (the sound manager, the audio engine, the bank
  pair and holders, the sound, the emitter, the listener, the XACT and
  XAudio engines); 4 leads added (XACT's body, X3DAudio and the engine
  sounds, the data tables, a file-layer helper). For review: XACT's
  vtable slots named only "probably <method>"; the intro records the
  user's call that XACT will probably be translated (it replaces "keep
  the game's XACT" in `native-audio.md`'s decisions, edited there 2026-10-23
  there); the 3D path never ran in play.
  Migration 1's 30 rows (7 Native; the intro's "Native so far"). For
  review: X3DAudioInitialize (`sub_82480710`, a library entry point,
  pure math) translated; it doesn't store the speed at r1+28 in its
  caller's frame as the original does (no caller reads it);
  SoundBankHolderDelete leaves out the call to the empty `sub_82106540`;
  the bank slot functions run the original where it traps, and the
  allocating ones unless the native heap is on; `sub_8259D438` runs the
  original when a handle is to be closed (never in play). The message
  handler `sub_82119188` left recompiled (guest vtable calls); the rest
  waits on XACT (the cue and engine calls through its vtables), the
  file layer and the string helpers; `sub_82092B78` (a std allocator)
  has no row anywhere.
  `xact.md` (new, 149 rows: the engine with Initialize, DoWork, the
  bank creation and categories, its global settings and audio callback
  `sub_825C0248` run by XAudio on its own thread, the sound and wave
  banks, the cue, sound and fader), `known-data.md`'s XACT objects, the
  `.xsb` and `.xwb` layouts, volume tables and clock globals; 4 leads
  (the rest of XACT, about 265 functions; the voice class with XAudio;
  shared helpers). For review: names follow the XACT3 interfaces where
  slots and arguments make them clear, else "probably"; the boundary
  named in the intro (XAudio's voices and callback, the kernel's
  critical sections and clock, XMemAlloc); a correction to
  `sound-cues.md` and `known-data.md` (the cue's slot +60 is
  GetProperties, writing the emitter's +136 block's first 14 bytes, not
  3D settings). The mapping agent read the vtables from `default.xex`
  decrypted and decompressed into its scratchpad with Python's
  `cryptography` and the retail key (nothing of it in the repo).
  Migration 1's 55 rows (46 Overridden, 9 Native; the intro's
  paragraphs on how the translation is set up). For review: a function
  calling its own object's vtable slot runs natively only while the
  slot holds the already-native function (GetHeader at sound bank +64,
  GetEntry and GetSeekTable at wave bank +16 and +20, AddListener at
  the bank interface's +0), else hands off to the original before
  changing anything; partial ports taking only the paths seen in play
  (`sub_825CA980` only a sound without tracks, `sub_825CC1D0` only an
  idle fader, `sub_825C8230` hands complex cues to the original);
  allocating functions run the original unless `--native_heap` is on.
  Left recompiled: the engine's critical section (no native lock in
  `src/`; the core's), the global settings' unmapped vtable slots,
  calls through vtables into recompiled code, unmapped callees.
  XACT's second map (37 rows in `xact.md`: the global settings'
  accessors, the renderer's voice slots, the sound classes' and
  listener slots, the wave entry's getters; 2 in `functions.md`:
  `sub_822956F0` probably GetTickCount, `sub_8220BC28` probably
  MenuList::GetPreviousSelection; `known-data.md`'s sound fields +96,
  +104, +120, +128; 1 lead, the code above the tracks). For review: the
  settings' slots +16, +20, +32, +36, +44, +48, +52, +56 "probably",
  from what callers do (no image dump read); for your call:
  GetTickCount made native means reading the kernel's timestamp bundle
  the SDK fills, or a host clock (left recompiled).
  XACT's migration 2 (46 rows ours: 39 Overridden, the rest Native, 7
  of them by adapter removal; the intro's settings vtable +0 to +68,
  read from the loaded image). For review: paths seen in play only,
  the rest handed to the original (`sub_825CC9C8` no optional sections,
  `sub_825CB470` flags without 0x2, `sub_825C27C0` no presets and no
  effect or both, `sub_825C2910` +100 is 0, `sub_825C6A20` +240 is 0,
  `sub_825C7798` no listener cues); `sub_825CC380` reads the bank's
  entry through the accessors instead of a stack copy (same words, all
  read before the stores); the folded getters `sub_82099BA0`,
  `sub_820A8958`, `sub_82379D50` overridden (same results for the game
  code folded with them); the harness's `Case` compares f1, a
  `Relocate` helper. Waiting on GetTickCount (your call): XACT's clock
  `sub_825BFE28` and everything above it.
  XACT's migration 3: `sub_825C8440` GetWaveRegion (builds its entry
  accessor in the original's stack slot, as the collision and matrix
  adapters do) and the folded getter `sub_8220BC28` (`functions.md`,
  one load of +20, the menus' callers get the same result) under
  `--native_xact`; 4 adapters removed.

## Run 2026-10-22 22:11 (`b7-loop-22-10-26-2`)

- `collision-world.md` (new, 43 rows), `known-data.md`'s mesh, route,
  course table and track position rows; corrections: `car-physics.md`'s
  CollisionObject::Collide (the first query's arguments: r3 the
  records, r4 the shape record), `collision.md`'s box words +160 (the
  lower corners' track positions), `sub_820C0168` probably the car's own
  track position; 5 leads added. Migration 1's 29 rows (and the intro:
  its constants; the up vector at `0x82638280`, not `0x82628280`). For
  review: a new `memory::IsPages`; the native normalize reproduces the
  vector unit's; `TrackPosition::SearchLinked` (never ran in play) writes
  -1 past its six halfwords onto the route's first at `0x826C5B10`, as
  the game does, kept; four functions ported that never ran in play are
  described in FindCell's row; the "Negated NaN" groups
  (`expected-differences.md`): ours flips a NaN's sign where the
  translated code doesn't. In four functions (`sub_820F6940`,
  `sub_820F8618`, `sub_820FEBD0`, `sub_820FC188`) the print comes after
  a guard that falls back to the recompiled code (the validation agent
  didn't count them as missing).
  Migration 2's rows: 11 in `collision-world.md` (the wall query,
  Unload; `sub_820FC870` named WallQuery::ModeSkips, ours), 3 in
  `car-physics.md` (CollisionWorld::Destroy, CollisionObject's
  destructors, under `--native_collision_world`: their only caller is
  Unload). For review: the wall hits are reached only by the harness (the
  AI cars don't touch walls; every path but EdgesAcrossWall's
  equal-lengths sum); TestCell and QueryWalls' harnesses don't compare r3
  (their callers don't read it); TestCell's up vector at `0x826382B0`,
  not `0x826282B0`; prints moved before the guards in GatherCells,
  TrackMesh::Free, TrackRoute::Free; a new `CollisionShapeDestroyable`
  in `collision.h`.

- `collision.md` (new, 64 rows), `known-data.md`'s shape, box, pair
  query and table entries, `car-physics.md`'s intro; 1 lead added (the
  track's collision queries). Guesses to confirm: the floats at
  `0x82002B90`..`0x82002B98` and the impulse scale at `0x82600E84`.
  Migration 1's 53 rows (35 Overridden, 18 Native) and the intro (the
  box's vtable slots, read at run time). For review: the native code
  reads the constants at `0x82002B90` and `0x820021E8` from guest memory,
  leaves out the box's type calls (slot 4 is `li r3,2`) and runs the
  original for any shape that isn't a box or when the impact table's
  box-box entry isn't `sub_820BF038`; the box copies' memcpys are native
  only where `c_runtime::Memcpy` records nothing. Map corrections:
  LowerCorner's ties and NaNs (k^2), NextCheckTime's radii (the +20
  shape), Shape::Shape zeroes +108's w.
  Migration 2's rows: 23 in `collision.md` (all 64 ours: 35 Native, 29
  Overridden), `car-physics.md`'s `sub_820B7B60` CollisionObject::Translate
  and `sub_820B2CC0` Vehicle::ApplyForces, `vehicle-accessors.md`'s new
  `sub_820988C0` RigidBody::Force (keeps its adapter: reached
  indirectly in play) and `sub_82379328` RigidBody::Torque. For review:
  the lifetime functions use `memory::crt` only while `--native_heap` is
  on, checking error paths first with a new `memory::IsHeapBlock`;
  PushOutCorners does the work of `sub_820BE0D8` and `sub_820BC8A8`
  (never ran in play, no rows); Respond's and Solve's "a fixed body
  meeting the impulse" groups (`expected-differences.md`).

- `heap.md`: 15 rows read in full and rewritten (no status changed), the
  intro's paragraph on native versions; migration 1's 15 rows (12
  Overridden, 3 Native; XMemAlloc's attribute bits corrected by the
  harness: protection `(attr >> 28) & 3`, default alignment field 12). For
  review: the adapters run the plain C++ only while `--native_heap` is
  active (`hooks::NativeHeapActive()`), and the error paths (errno, the
  new handler, `bad_alloc`, `_invalid_parameter`) run `__imp__` from the
  start; `known-data.md`'s heap globals;
  1 lead added (`sub_8235AAC0`), operator new taken from the
  VirtualAlloc lead.

## Run 2026-10-22 14:39 (`b7-loop-22-10-26`)

- `car-physics.md`: migration 1's 41 rows (names marked "ours" where the
  map had none) and the intro (the identity quaternion is at
  `0x826381B0`, not the map's `0x825F81B0`); `vehicle-accessors.md`:
  5 rows. For review: the vector library fixed (ee810a9): ThinLTO could
  move `dpps` out of its flush-to-zero window, found by the car physics'
  harness ("tiny values" groups added, at 0); ContactImpulse's harness
  has a "one NaN meeting its own negation (expected to differ)" group
  (3 cases, 2 differ); the "numbers" groups keep values below 10^6 (no
  infinities made). ContactImpulseWith runs the original for a fixed
  body (whose term the original reads from its stack's leftovers).
  Migration 2's 19 rows. For review: UpdateSteering's harness doesn't
  compare r3 (on the tan path the original leaves `_ctrlfp`'s word
  there; the step sets r3 again); the adapters run the original for
  UpdateSteering when tan would take its `_except1` path, and for
  UpdateTorqueSplit in mode 2 in a forward gear (neither seen in play).
  Migration 3's rows (38 in `car-physics.md`, one new: `sub_820BAA78`
  CollisionShape::Init; `sub_820B4CF0`'s r4 corrected: clear means
  automatic shifts) and 2 in `vehicle-accessors.md`.
  Migration 4's 15 rows in `car-physics.md` and 4 in
  `vehicle-accessors.md`. For review: RemovePair copies a moved pair
  with `c_runtime::Memcpy` only outside the physical views and for
  ranges that don't overlap; otherwise RemoveObject's and RemoveGroups'
  adapters run the original removals from the start (the same result).
- `car-physics.md` (new, 129 rows), `known-data.md`'s new rows, 5 leads
  added (the collision narrow phase and shapes, and others).
- `race-overlays.md`: the matrix-math lead's rows (UpdateLightSprites,
  UpdateParticlesB, UpdateParticlesC, UpdateSmoke, Smoke::SetFrame,
  ModelMatrix, ParticlesB::Emit's f1 corrected to +6256) and 23 adapters
  removed (Native). For review: native callers of Vec4::Transform go
  through a new `debug::Vec4Transform`, which keeps its override's
  `--debug_hide` and frame-state checks; UpdateSmoke stores its size word
  quieted when it comes from the table (as the translated code, which
  keeps it as a double); its harness never uses a smoke capacity of -1
  (the original would copy into 2^32 - 1 emitters).
- `matrix-math.md` (new, 28 rows; 4 moved from `functions.md`), 1 lead
  added. Migration 1's 21 rows (15 Overridden, 3 of them were Wrapped;
  3 Native with no adapter ever; 3 Merged). For review: the three
  Wrapped functions' overrides (Multiply and Copy in
  `src/interpolation/blend_state.cpp`, Vec4::Transform in
  `src/debug/frame_state_diff.cpp`) now do the work natively, with the
  same hooks around it; frame dumps with the flag on and off look the
  same.
  Migration 2's 8 rows. For review: the turns' "one NaN" harness group
  keeps the angle within 1024 (a huge finite angle overflows the game's
  sine and cosine polynomials to NaNs of both signs, which then meet in
  Multiply); the "NaNs anywhere" group keeps every angle. The native
  turns note their multiply for interpolation through a new
  `interpolation::BlendState_OnMultiply` (as the Multiply wrapper does).
- `race-overlays.md`: the no-mapping lead's 14 rows (the view's body and
  wheel accessors, IsBehindCamera, the save flags and stage check,
  UpdateTrails, MarkerKind; FlagsKind `sub_82122DB8` and NoSaveFlags
  `sub_82127198` ported with MarkerKind but never ran in play, so no
  rows) and 6 adapters removed; `vehicle-accessors.md`: `sub_820C0170`,
  `sub_820C0180` Native. The new harnesses run the originals with the
  accessors' flags off too (an `Original<>` wrapper).
- `vehicle-accessors.md`: migration 1's 127 rows (2 now Native, adapters
  removed). For review: the two Wrapped rows (`sub_82593FB0`,
  `sub_820FFD88`) had their frame-state-diff wrappers moved into their
  adapters (out of `src/debug/frame_state_diff.cpp`).
- `vehicle-accessors.md` (new, 132 rows; 3 moved from `functions.md`),
  `known-data.md`'s new rows, 5 leads added.

## Run 2026-10-22 10:47 (`b7-loop-22-10-26`)

- `c-runtime.md`, `ui-movies.md`, `ui-movies-game.md`, `sprites.md`: the
  adapters lead's rows (Overridden -> Native, and notes on the 4 kept).
- `race-overlays.md` (new, 154 rows; `sub_8215DEA0` moved from
  `functions.md`), `sprites.md`'s intro, `known-data.md`'s new rows;
  the first migration's 34 rows (Overridden). For review: RacerId's
  adapter (`sub_82126AE0`) sign-extends r3 where the original
  zero-extends a found id (only the upper 32 bits; callers compare 32).
  The second migration's 6 rows and the 9 names.
  The third migration's 10 rows (4 new). For review: NaN-only harness
  results depend on which operand the compiler kept in the translated
  vector adds: Smoke::Emit keeps the first operand's NaN (as the Xenon
  does), the sparks a plain `addps` matching how this build compiled
  theirs; a rebuild could bring back NaN-only differences there.
  The fourth migration's 32 rows, and `sub_820C0128`'s notes in
  `functions.md`. For review: on the native SpeedKmh path the state
  capture (`--capture_dir`) no longer hears about the vehicle (the
  game's other callers still pass it on).
  The fifth migration's 8 rows (4 Overridden, `sub_8215E078` Merged, 3
  Native). `attract_race.sh` now counts seconds logged at 31 ticks/s too
  (it reported 19 for a 22-second race).
